This is syntax highlighting, block grouping, and auto completion for TagTool command scripts for Notepad++. Originally authored by ButReallyTho, the author has not been reachable for years and these files greatly benefit TagTool users so I have decided to open source them for the benefit of the community.

To install, copy the TagTool.xml file in %appdata%\Notepad++\userDefineLangs to that folder on your pc, you can just paste that into your address bar and it should take you to the correct location.
For auto completion, copy the TagTool.xml file from Notepad++ Program Folder\autoCompletion to your local folder, for example C:\Program Files\Notepad++\autoCompletion\
